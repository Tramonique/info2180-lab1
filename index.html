            Hi, my name is Tramonique but most people call me Tram. I’m 26 years old and 
            currently studying Computer Science at The University of the West Indies. 
            Along with school, I also work as a freelancer doing event support 
            and taking on different projects. It keeps me pretty busy, but 
            I enjoy learning new skills and challenging myself in different ways.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am interested in web development because I like creating things that people 
            can see and interact with. It combines problem solving with creativity, which 
            makes it both challenging and fun. I also enjoy that the field is always changing, 
            so there is always something new to learn and improve on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work and school, I enjoy activities that help me relax and recharge. 
            I spend a lot of time watching anime, movies, and TV shows, or listening to 
            music and reading. I also like exploring new interests when I get the chance. 
            These hobbies give me balance and keep me motivated as I continue working 
            towards my academic and career goals.
        </p>

            For me, life is about finding balance between responsibilities and the things 
            that bring joy. I try to stay focused on my goals, but I also make time to enjoy 
            the little things, whether that’s watching a new anime, trying something new, 
            or just spending time with the people I love.
